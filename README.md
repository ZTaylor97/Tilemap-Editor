# Tilemap-Editor
A very basic c++ tilemap editor for use with SDL 

This tilemap editor is intended for use for basic 2D games.
I plan to make it a full level editor later on but for now this will do.

(talking to myself here but anyway)
Feel free to clean up the code if you want and add any unimplemented features that are listed in the commit
Yeah, I know there are better ways to communicate this but honestly no one is going to read this haha.
